<h3>Capabilities of ROWL</h3> 
<ol>
<li> Gives user way to enter OWL axioms by writing rules rather than creating axioms in protege. </li>
<li> If a rule is successfully converted to OWL Axiom User will get the option to choose which axioms he want to integrate. </li>
<li> If a rule is not successfully converted to OWL Axiom it gives the option to switch to SWRL tab(Existing to SWRLTab Plugin) </li>
<li> It can save and reload the rules(Which rules is converted to OWL Axioms and at-least 1 axiom is integrated with ontology from that rule. </li>
<li> It checks syntax of the rule. It supports SWRL Rule Syntax. </li>
<li> It can create new OWL Entity on the fly. That means user can create new OWL Entity like Class, ObjectProperty etc from this plugin. </li>
</ol>

     
<h3>Current Limitations:</h3> 
<ul>
<li> It checks the syntax of the rule, not semantics. It is possible to insert meaningless rule which is syntactically correct. </li>
<li> It doesn't support DataLog Syntax. </li>
</ul>
